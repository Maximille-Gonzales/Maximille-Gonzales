A business intelligence analyst from California. My skills include business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, SQL, Tableau, and Google Workspace. Now, I am eager to leverage my big data and visualization skills to drive growth, boost sales and guide business decisions driven by data.

Currently, I am an experienced tour guide, commercial photographer and the chief communications manager and co-host of the Globetrotters Podcast. The responsibilities of these roles range from operations, customer engagement, website development, digital and social media marketing and partnership outreach and communication. These roles have helped me develop my communication, analytical, time and project management, and problem-solving skills. In 2024, I enrolled in the TripleTen 5-month Business Intelligence Analyst program. The curriculum covered spreadsheets (data cleaning and preprocessing, pivot tables, graphics and charts), SQL databases (SQL as a tool for working with data, advanced scl features for analysts, relationships between tables), business analytics (business, funnel, cohort and user metrics), data visualization with Tableau (building and reading interactive charts), and storytelling with data (utilizing Tableau dashboards and stories to build data driven stories), and more. It also involved numerous practical projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently broadening my understanding of all things BIA - SQL, Tableau, Data visualizations and storytelling - in order to become a better BI Analyst.

- 🏊🏼‍♂️ I was a collegiate athlete at the University of California Santa Cruz where I wrapped up my 20 year swimming career.

- 🏃🏼‍♂️ I love being active: I currently run, play tennis, basketball, cycle, hike, camp, climb, practice yoga, and of course, swim.

- 🛂 I have been to more than 30 countries and promote travel for mental health as a co-host on the Globetrotters Podcast!

- 📸 I previously had a commercial photography business where I captured events, weddings, portraits, product and travel photography.
  
- 🎯 My goals for 2024: landing my dream job in data. And becoming more fluent in Spanish!
